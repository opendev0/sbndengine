The SBND engine is separated by interface classes and their implementation

src/include:	interfaces
src/sbndengine:	implementation
src/sys_glut:	system specific implementation -> GLUT specific implementation

There should be a README file in every subfolder with more information


This engine is based on the book "Game Physics Engine Development" by Ian Millington
