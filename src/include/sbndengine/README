The SBND Engine itself

file naming conventions:

 * header files with prefixed i are intended to be standard interfaces.

 * header files with prefixed c are intended to be specialized classes
   which are abstracted by the generic interfaces.
   
   This makes it possible to use different implementations (like a camera
   implementing a look at function and a camera acting like a first person
   player) with the same interface. Usually we are only interested in the
   matrix which is handed back by the camera class


./camera:	Camera handling
./engine:	Backbone of whole engine
./graphics:	Contains all interfaces related to graphics
./physics:	Contains all interfaces related to physics
